# Models

Models work as an abstraction for the database and work as an ORM to help us create tables and perform CRUD operations.

#### Basic example

```
from django.db import models

class Person(models.Model):
    first_name = models.CharField(max_length=30)
    last_name = models.CharField(max_length=30)
```
